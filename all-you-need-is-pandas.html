Hello everyone, and thanks for joining!
</p>

<p>
My name is Dimiter Naydenov, and today I'm going to talk about my experiences with
the awesome Pandas library, why I love it, and how surprisingly practical I found it to be.
</p>

<p>
Let me start tell you a bit about myself first.

I've been a software developer for more than 20 years now.
</p>

<p>
I started way back with Basic and Logo, went through Pascal, Delphi, C/C++,
then C# in the early days of .NET. For 3 years I even did some PHP, and quite
a lot of JavaScript. Soon after I discovered Python, initially for web-based
projects with the just recently released Django, later also for desktop
applications, scripting, and more backend stuff. More recently, I've been using
Go to build cloud-based software at my job. After 4 years of that I decided to
become my own boss, started a small company, and got full-time into freelancing.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm using Python again full-time, and I'm quite happy about it.

So what about Pandas?
</p>

<p>
:)
</p>

<p>
How many of you have used Pandas at least once?
</p>

<p>
Wow, a lot of people, nice!
That's great, as my talk is not an introduction to Pandas.
</p>

<p>
I've heard about Pandas at EuroPython 2012, and since then I kept hearing a lot
more about it from different people. As Pandas internally uses NumPy, I was not
particularly keen about trying it. I've used NumPy before, but only occasionally
and mostly because it's very fast, but I still find it counter-intuitive, even
awkward to use.
</p>

<p>
A couple of years later I decided to give Pandas a try anyway, and after skimming
over the very good documentation

Pandas is great for data processing, analysis, reporting, visualization, and can handle
many thousands of rows quickly and efficiently. Among the Data Science field,
It's quite popular among those into
Big Data, Machine Learning
