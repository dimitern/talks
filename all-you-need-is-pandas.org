#+BEGIN_NOTES

Hello everyone, and thanks for joining!

My name is Dimiter Naydenov, and I'm excited to present to you my first ever EuroPython talk.

I'm quite passionate about Pandas, and by the end of my talk I hope you would be as well!

Let me tell you a bit about myself first.

 #+BEGIN_NOTES

I've been a developer for over 20 years, starting with Basic and Pascal, then C++, C#,
even PHP for 3 years, and then I discovered Python through Django.

Since then, Python became my favourite language, and I've used it for all kinds of projects,
including web, desktop, and mobile applications, scripting and server-side software.

For 4 years I worked on porting a cloud deployment suite from Python to Go, and then I went
full-time into freelancing with Python, founding my own small company - develated.

So what about Pandas?

  * Open source (BSD-licensed) Python library
  * Created by Wes McKinney in 2008
  * High-performance, easy-to-use data structures
  * Great API for data analysis, built on top of [[http://www.numpy.org/][NumPy]]
  * Well documented: [[http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/][pandas.pydata.org/pandas-doc/stable/]]

 #+BEGIN_NOTES

How many of you know about Pandas?

OK, great!

How many of you use Pandas regularly?

Awesome!

OK, for those of you not familiar with it, here is a quick overview.

Pandas is an open source Python library for data analysis, created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and a great API for data analysis,
built on top of NumPy.

It is very well documented, actively supported, and has a large community of users
and contributors.

* Pandas: Personal Favourites

:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 * Easy to install, very few requirements
 * Fast as NumPy, yet more flexible and nicer to use
 * Reads/writes data in the most common formats
 * Works seamlessly with [[https://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] for plotting

#+BEGIN_NOTES

First time I've heard about Pandas was at EuroPython 2012, and since then I keep hearing
more and more about it from many people.

It's easy to install, especially on Linux, but also on Windows or Mac OS.

Unlike NumPy, which I still find awkward and counter-intuitive to work with, Pandas is
much nicer to use, more flexible, yet still as fast as NumPy.

Reading and writing data in multiple formats, like CSV, Excel, HDF5, to name a few is
also an obvious advantage for me.

And since I think visually most of the time, I liked how easy it is produce matplotlib plots
from Pandas.

* Pandas: Personal Pain Points
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pandas-pain-points
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 * Good documentation, but not a lot of tutorials
 * Confusingly many ways to do the same thing
 * Arcane indexing, even without MultiIndex
 * Sane defaults, but can be "too smart" in some cases

#+BEGIN_NOTES

So I tried Pandas, but ultimately could not find a good use for it at the time.

/Goal:/ Send personalized mail, labeled in sender's handwriting.

** Requirements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: svg-requirements
:END:
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
   1. Acquire samples of users' handwriting as SVG files
   2. Extract individual letter/symbol SVGs from each sample page
   3. Compose arbitrary word SVGs using the letters
   4. Generate mail label SVGs from those words

** Acquiring Handwriting Samples
