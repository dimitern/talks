Hello everyone, and thanks for joining!

My name is Dimiter Naydenov, and today I'm going to talk about my experiences with
the awesome Pandas library, why I love it, and how surprisingly practical I found it to be.

Let me start by telling you a bit about myself first.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

I've started over 20 years ago with Basic, went through Pascal, C++, C#,
even PHP for 3 years, before I discovering Python through Django.

Python became my favourite language, and I've used it for web, desktop, and backend software.

For 4 years I developed a cloud deployment suite in Go at work, then I decided
to go on my own, started a small company, and got full-time into freelancing.

So what about Pandas?

:)

** =import pandas as pd=

  * Open source (BSD-licensed) Python library
  * Easy-to-use, high-performance data structures
  * Great for tools for data analysis, built on top of [[http://www.numpy.org/][NumPy]]
  * Well documented: [[http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/][pandas.pydata.org/pandas-doc/stable/]]

 #+BEGIN_NOTES

 How many of you have never used Pandas or even heard about it?

 ----if-more-than-a-few------------------------------------------------------------
 OK, so here is a quick overview.

 Pandas is an open source Python library for data analysis, built on top of NumPy,
 created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

 It is very well documented, actively supported, and has a large community of users
 and contributors.

 ----if-just-a-few-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Wow, not a lot of people, that's great! No need for an introduction then.

* Why Pandas?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
 * Easy to install, very few requirements
 * Nicer to use, and more flexible than NumPy
 * Reads/writes data in most formats you'd need

#+BEGIN_NOTES

First time I've heard about Pandas was at EuroPython 2012, and since then I keep hearing
more and more about it from many people.

I really liked how much nicer to use Pandas is compared to NumPy, which I still find
awkward and counter-intuitive.

It can also read and write data in many formats, including CSV, Excel, HDF5, to name
just a few.


So I had tried Pandas, but at the time I could not find a good use for it.
