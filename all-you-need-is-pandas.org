#+BEGIN_NOTES

Hello everyone, and thanks for joining!

My name is Dimiter Naydenov, and today I'm going to talk about my experiences with
the awesome Pandas library, why I love it, and how surprisingly practical I found it to be.

Let me start tell you a bit about myself first.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

I've been a software developer for more than 20 years now.

I started way back with Basic and Logo, went through Pascal, Delphi, C/C++,
then C# in the early days of .NET. For 3 years I even did some PHP, and quite
a lot of JavaScript. Soon after I discovered Python, initially for web-based
projects with the just recently released Django, later also for desktop
applications, scripting, and more backend stuff. More recently, I've been using
Go to build cloud-based software at my job. After 4 years of that I decided to
become my own boss, started a small company, and got full-time into freelancing.

Now I'm using Python again full-time, and I'm quite happy about it.

So what about Pandas?

:)

How many of you have used Pandas at least once?

Wow, a lot of people, nice!
That's great, as my talk is not an introduction to Pandas.

I've heard about Pandas at EuroPython 2012, and since then I kept hearing a lot
more about it from different people. As Pandas internally uses NumPy, I was not
particularly keen about trying it. I've used NumPy before, but only occasionally
and mostly because it's very fast, but I still find it counter-intuitive, even
awkward to use.

A couple of years later I decided to give Pandas a try anyway, and after skimming
over the very good documentation
